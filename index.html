	<p style="font-size:200%">It is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of Sir Charles Barkey, our cherished canine companion.<br>
	Sir Charles was more than just a dog—he was a true friend, confidant, and source of endless joy. His playful antics, <br>
	curious nature, and infectious enthusiasm brought light into every room he entered, leaving a lasting impression<br>
	on everyone who had the pleasure of meeting him.<br><br>

	From the moment he bounded into our lives, Sir Charles filled our days with laughter and warmth. Whether he was <br>
	eagerly chasing after his favorite toy, lounging in the sun, or offering his quiet support, he always knew how to make us<br> 
	feel loved and appreciated. His loyalty and gentle spirit were unmatched, and he had an uncanny ability to brighten the toughest of days.<br><br>

	Though he may no longer be with us, the love and joy he brought into our lives will never fade. We find comfort in the<br> 		
	beautiful memories we shared with Sir Charles, and his spirit will forever remain in our hearts. Rest in peace, <br>
	dear friend—you will be deeply missed, but your legacy of love and happiness will continue to inspire us every day.<br><br>
